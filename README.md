A talk

min 1
 - stephen / red badger / hiring for ?
 - web dev since 1995 and commercially since 1997
 - or semantic markup engineer or whatever
 - when adam said i only had twelve minutes i thought i could do "12 somethings", one a minute
 - so yeah, a talk version of those stupid listicles
 - 9 Great SEO Hacks to Bootstrap your Social Network for Cats
 - and i've even found a load of totally irrelevant images to go with each point
 - except I've spent the first minute talking about myself so its going to be 11 somethings
 - and just to make it more fun the slides auto-advance so there will either be awkward gaps or i'll be cutting myself off mid sentence

min 2
 - don't do your slides in HTML
 - as a developer it might make you feel cleverer
 - but if you're anything like me, you have the idea, have no idea if its even possible with powerpoint
 - and you go through the 400 web slide deck frameworks that are out there and none of them look quite right
 - then think 'fuck it, i'll just use javascript'
 - so that's made the problem go away, right?
 - so you sit back and think "I've got this"
 - then its a week before the event and you have nothing
 - which is why I was still studying a SVG graphing library at 10pm last night
 - but we got there. and hopefully they'll keep working for the next 10 minutes

min 3
 - The best time to learn is now
 - don't put it off, just pick it up whenever you think of it
 - eg kept intending to learn Flash from about, say, 1999 to 2008
 - of course eventually the problem just gets designed away (thanks Apple)
 - and I'm in the same situation with rails now (sort of)
 - we're using it on client projects so i'm kind of dragged along but only 2-3 years after i first meant to look at it
 - so just get on with it

min 4
 - of course when you're learning a load of stuff it gets harder to remember how to do things
 - this multi-coloured barf is an approximation of all the languages i've used over the years
 - and its even more complex than that because you have various phases of HTML and CSS
 - and the brief two weeks in 2002 when i actually understood object oriented Javascript
 - so whenever some really code-specific question comes up in an interview, and you choke on it
 - relax about forgetting the syntax
 - think about what they're actually hiring for - a perfect memory or an understanding of software engineering
 - i'm not saying call them on it, but realising this certainly made me rethink how I would conduct an interview myself
 - chris coyier coincidentally had a great blog post on this about a week ago (http://css-tricks.com/syntax-vs-spirit/)

min 5
 - this is from an amazing episode of Community, one of the best, stupidest TV shows from the States
 - i guess the corollary to the last point is that its ok to have comfort blankets
 - its great to learn and pick up new stuff, and find ways to use it
 - but its also completely fine to have a few old favourites you know you can rely on to get the work done
 - personally that is knockout, which has always had that slight veneer of not-quite-coolness to it
 - but i still haven't found anything to binds to HTML as easily
 - so its my go-to for rapid prototyping because I know I can get something complex going really fast
 - i'm always wary of getting stuck in a groove, because i remember being the young guy who came into an agency
 - and there was always someone who was like "Java applets will solve this" and you're <grumbling noise>
 - but keep an open mind and carry a good toolbox - can't fail

min 6
 - i love this
 - it's a sundial in the gardens of Rudyard Kipling's house, Batemans, near where I live in Sussex
 - if you can't read it the inscription says 'It's later than you think'
 - no idea if that was his quote, but it perfectly sums up my relationship with time
 - time has a habit of vanishing
 - regardless of what you're working on you can never quite fit as much into the working day as you think you should be able to
 - whether that's from distractions or things not working right the first time or just your mind wandering on to a different idea
 - because that happens to everyone, right?
 - and i've done my share of crunch projects to know it isn't productive to force more work out of yourself
 - which is why in agile world we at least plan for it by accepting you can't be typing code 8 hours a day
 - and another reason why there are only 11 somethings in this talk about 12 somethings

min 7
 - i guess related to this, is the growing idea in web develoment - the front end world at least - is that automation is a good thing
 - whether that's using grunt to build stuff, compiled static sites, languages that compile to other languages
 - which is great for me because i'm lazy, but I also resisted picking it up
 - because I'm lazy
 - but i don't feel like i've mastered it, and

 - i know some people don't like it because they feel that front end 

 - is it a good idea? oh god i don't know


min 8
 - burnout / imposter syndrome?

min 9
 - making your slides in HTML always sounds like a good idea
 - it never is (hopefully its still working by this point)
 - but it is still less of a horror show than trying to learn powerpoint

min 10
 - learning how to say no
 - trusting your instinctive judgement

min 11
 - don't get acquired
 - unless its for somewhere you would have chosen to work anyway

min 12
 - If you don't love it, don't do it
 - career interest graph
 - end / contacts


others
 - i'm terrible at organising myself (so no more freelance)
